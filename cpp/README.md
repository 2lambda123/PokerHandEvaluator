# C/C++ Library

## Compile and test

Run `make` to build the `unit_tests` binaray.

Run `make test` to build the unit test and run it.

Run `make libpheval.a` to build the library only.

## Use the library

After building the library `libpheval.a`, you can add the `./include`
directory to your includes path (e.g. `g++ -I ./include`).

### C methods

PH Evaluator was originally coded in C, so it still preserves the C functions.

```cpp
int evaluate_5cards(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e);
int evaluate_6cards(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f);
int evaluate_7cards(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f, int g);
```

However using these functions, user needs to convert his card into an integer
ranged `[0, 52)`. You can find the mapping in the section [Card Id](#cardid).

The return value is an integer indicating the rank of the hand, in the range
`[1, 7452]` with the strongest hands (Royal straight flush) returning 1, the
second strongest hands (King high straight flush) returning 2, and the weakest
hands returning 7462.

Both the input and output is identical to the Cactus Kev's evaluator.

### C++ methods

In addition to the C methods, more handy C++ methods can be used to get the
same result.

```cpp
int EvaluateCards(Card a, Card b, Card c, Card d, Card e);
int EvaluateCards(Card a, Card b, Card c, Card d, Card e, Card f);
int EvaluateCards(Card a, Card b, Card c, Card d, Card e, Card f, Card g);
```

The Card can be constructed with either a [card id](#cardid), or a string
representation. For example:

```cpp
Card a(3); // 2 in Spades
Card b("AH"); // Ace in Hearts
```

The return value is the same to the C version, which is an integer in the
range `[1, 7452]` indicating the rank of the hand, where a smaller number
is stronger.

<a name="cardid"></a>
## Card Id

We use an integer to represent a card. The two least significant bits
represent the 4 suits, ranged from 0-3. The rest of it represent the 13
ranks, ranged from 0-12.

More specifically:
deuce = 0, trey = 1, four = 2, five = 3, six = 4, seven = 5, eight = 6,
nine = 7, ten = 8, jack = 9, queen = 10, king = 11, ace = 12.

13 * 4 gives all 52 ids.
 
So the complete card Id representation is:

|   | C | D | H | S |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 4 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11|
| 5 | 12| 13| 14| 15|
| 6 | 16| 17| 18| 19|
| 7 | 20| 21| 22| 23|
| 8 | 24| 25| 26| 27|
| 9 | 28| 29| 30| 31|
| T | 32| 33| 34| 35|
| J | 36| 37| 38| 39|
| Q | 40| 41| 42| 43|
| K | 44| 45| 46| 47|
| A | 48| 49| 50| 51|
