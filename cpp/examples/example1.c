	 * The least two significant bits represents the suit.
	 * As long as they are distinct, it's OK.
	 * Here we use 0 for club, 1 for diamond, 2 for heart, and 3 for spade.
	 *
	 * The rest of the bits represents the rank, the rank values are:
	 * deuce = 0, trey = 1, four = 2, five = 3, six = 4, seven = 5, eight = 6,
	 * nine = 7, ten = 8, jack = 9, queen = 10, king = 11, ace = 12.
	 *
	 * We can use the formula `rank * 4 + suit` to get the card id.
	 *
	 *
	 * In this example we use a scenario in the game Texas Holdem:
	 * Community cards: 9c 4c 4s 9d 4h (both player share this cards)
	 * Player 1: Qc 6c
	 * Player 2: 2c 9h
	 *
	 * Both player have a full house, but player 1 only has a four full house
	 * while player 2 has a nine full house.
	 * The result should be player 2 has a stronger hand than player 1.
